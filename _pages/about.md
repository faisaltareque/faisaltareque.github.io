Welcome!

My name is Faisal Tareque Shohan, and I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu/ "https://aust.edu/") in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I am actively collaborating with [Mir Tafseer Nayeem](https://tafseer-nayeem.github.io/ "Personal Profile") from the University of Alberta, Canada, and have previously collaborated with [Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/ "Personal Profile"). My earlier research endeavors were guided by Dr. [Muhammad Ibrahim](https://du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/CSE/4167 "Academic profile") and Prof. Dr. [Mohammad Shafiul Alam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=5ZXfn_cAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate "Research profile"). My research interests encompass natural language processing, computational linguistics, information retrieval, and machine learning. <span style="color:Green">Recently, one of my long papers was accepted at [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/ "ACL 2024") (Findings), and another at [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org/ "EACL 2023") (Main).</span>
